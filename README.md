# Gordo Components

---

## About:
Gordo-Components is part of the common ML ops provided by `gordo`  (_TODO: Link to repo once created_)

It fulfills the role of inhaling config files and supplying components to the pipeline of:

1. Fetching data
2. Training model
3. Serving model

It is designed to be used _by_ `gordo` and not (at present) as a standalone tool.

## Install: 
`python setup.py install`  
or...  
`pip install git+https://github.com/Statoil/gordo-components.git`

## Uninstall:
`pip uninstall gordo-components`
