Serializer
----------

The serializer is the core component used in the conversion of a Gordo config
file into Python objects which interact in order to construct a full ML model
capable of being served on Kubernetes.

Things like the ``dataset`` and ``model`` keys within the YAML config represents
objects which will be (de)serialized by the serializer to complete this goal.

Into Definitiion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ability to take a Python object, such as a scikit-learn
pipeline and convert it into a primitive ``dict``, which can then be inserted
into a YAML config file.
